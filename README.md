A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for different use cases based on performance and user 

### Output:
### The Basics of Blockchain Technology
### ChatGPT:

Blockchain is a digital system that records and checks information in a secure and 
transparent way. Unlike traditional databases managed by one company, blockchain is 
decentralized, meaning data is stored across many computers. Information is grouped 
into “blocks,” and each block is connected to the previous one, forming a permanent 
“chain.” Once data is added, it cannot be easily changed, which makes the system 
reliable. Blockchain uses cryptography (secret codes) and consensus (agreement 
among computers) to confirm transactions.

The most popular use of blockchain is in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, 
where it keeps financial records safe without banks. It is also used in supply chains to 
trace goods from factories to stores, in healthcare to protect patient records, and in
voting systems to make elections more secure. In short, blockchain builds trust in 
digital information without needing a middleman.

### Gemini: 

Blockchain is a super secure way to keep track of information using a digital list that's 
shared by many different computers. Each new entry, or block, is connected to the last 
one, forming a chain that is almost impossible to change. Because no one person or 
company owns the list, and everyone has a copy, it's very safe and transparent.

Instead of relying on a bank, people can use blockchain for things like:


• Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin: You can send money to someone without needing 
a bank to approve the transaction.

• Supply Chain Tracking: Companies can follow a product's journey, from the farm 
to the store, to prove it's authentic and ethically sourced. This prevents fake goods 
from entering the market.

### Meta: 

Blockchain is like a super-secure digital notebook shared across many computers. It 
organizes data into blocks linked together in a chain, ensuring that once something is 
added, it can’t be changed or erased. This setup makes blockchain decentralized—no 
single person or company owns it—and transactions are verified by multiple participants 
(nodes) in the network, making it tamper-proof and trustworthy.

It’s used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, enabling secure, peer-to-peer transactions 
without banks. Another example is supply chain management, where blockchain tracks 
goods from production to delivery, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. For 
instance, Walmart uses blockchain to trace food safety issues quickly.


Blockchain’s benefits include transparency, security, and efficiency, making it a gamechanger for industries like voting, healthcare, and finance. Imagine voting securely online 
or tracking medicine authenticity—all powered by blockchain!

### Claude: 

Blockchain is like a digital record book that's shared across many computers instead of 
being stored in one place. Think of it as a chain of boxes (blocks) where each box contains 
transaction information. Once a box is added to the chain, it's nearly impossible to 
change, making the records super secure and trustworthy.

The key benefits are transparency (everyone can see the transactions), security 
(advanced encryption protects the data), and decentralization (no single company 
controls it). When someone makes a transaction, computers in the network check if it's 
valid, then add it to a new block.


Real-world examples include Walmart using blockchain to track food from farms to 
stores, helping quickly find contamination sources during food safety issues. In 
healthcare, it securely stores patient records that can be safely shared between doctors 
and hospitals while protecting privacy.


### Cohere Command:
Blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. 
Unlike traditional ledgers, it’s decentralized, meaning no single person or group controls 
it. Instead, data is stored in "blocks" linked together in a chain, making it nearly 
impossible to alter past records. Each transaction is verified by a network of users, 
ensuring trust without intermediaries like banks.

Real-World Examples:


1. **Bitcoin**: The first and most famous blockchain application, Bitcoin uses 
blockchain to enable peer-to-peer digital currency transactions without banks.


2. **Supply Chain Tracking**: Companies like Walmart use blockchain to track food 
products from farm to store, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. 


Blockchain’s key features—security, transparency, and decentralization—make it useful 
beyond finance, from voting systems to healthcare records. It’s a game-changing 
technology reshaping how we trust and verify data.

explanations more relatable.


➢ ChatGPT (GPT-5) provides the most academic and classroom-ready summary, 
with structured flow and broader industry examples. 


➢ Meta is the most technical, covering advanced concepts like hashes and 
cryptography.


➢ Cohere gives a balanced explanation, with a unique mention of blockchain’s 
energy consumption, but less engaging examples.


Final Ranking for Undergraduate Use: 


1. Claude (easy to understand) 

2. Gemini (engaging and relatable)

3. ChatGPT (clear and academic) 

4. Meta (technical and detailed)

5. Cohere (balanced but less unique).
